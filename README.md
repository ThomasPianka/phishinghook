# Phishing Hook
This project contains five models spread across two code files. The first model, 
a simple deep neural network, is in [model1.py](model1.py). To run it, the following packages need to be installed:
* matplotlib
* pandas
* pytorch
* scikit-learn

The remaining models, models two through five, are found in [models2to5.ipynb](models2to5.ipynb). To run them, the following
packages need to be installed:
* jupyter
* matplotlib
* pandas
* pytorch
* scikit-learn
* seaborn
* tensorflow
* transformers
